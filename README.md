# Hello World Informed

ðŸ“± "I'm a physical device!" Hello World Informed is a simple Hello World Flutter app that displays "info bits" â€“ short pieces of device data â€“ in a first-person style. These info bits can be viewed randomly on the home screen, refreshed with a shuffle button, or browsed in a scrollable list.

Hello World Informed is yet another take on the classic "Hello, World!" program, a traditional first step in learning a new programming language or framework. While typical "Hello, World!" programs simply display text, this app expands on that concept by showing (some) device information in a more dynamic and interactive way. Being open-source, with well-commented code and examples of common mobile UI elements (AppBar, FAB, list views, navigation between two screens, etc.), it offers potential educational value for those learning Flutter development.
