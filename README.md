ðŸ“± "I'm a physical device!" Hello World Informed is a simple Hello World Flutter app that displays "info bits" â€“ short pieces of device data â€“ in a first-person style. These info bits can be viewed randomly on the home screen, refreshed with a shuffle button, or browsed in a scrollable list. The app uses a clean and simple black and white theme.

Hello World Informed is yet another take on the classic "Hello, World!" program, a traditional first step in learning a new programming language or framework. While typical "Hello, World!" programs simply display text, this app expands on that concept by showing (some) device information in a more dynamic and interactive way. Being open-source, with well-commented code and examples of common mobile UI elements (AppBar, FAB, list views, navigation between two screens, etc.), it offers potential educational value for those learning Flutter development.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need the Flutter SDK installed on your machine.  If you don't have it already, follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Once you have Flutter installed, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aurelitec/hello_world_informed.git
   cd hello_world_informed
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Connect a device (or use an emulator):**

    Make sure you have a physical Android device connected to your computer in developer mode, or have an Android emulator running.

4. **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

This command will build the app and install it on your connected device or emulator.
